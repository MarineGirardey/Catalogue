# 🧪 Technical Test – Report

## ✅ Approach

I started by reviewing documentation to refresh my knowledge of native PHP and JavaScript.

I chose **not to use any frameworks**, as the project was simple and I didn’t want to spend time setting one up unnecessarily.

I referred to documentation and online resources, particularly for the checkbox filtering function. The code of this part is not the easiest to read, but it works.

## ⚠️ Difficulties

- Remembering how to use native functions, as I’m more used to work with frameworks.
- Time management: I’m a bit disappointed because I struggled with simple functionalities and feel I could have done more.

## 🛠️ What remains to be done

- Tailwind styles could be extracted into a dedicated CSS file to clean up the HTML.
- Responsive design could be improved by using flex containers to wrap content properly.

## 💡 Other suggestions

If there were many filters and a large amount of data, it would be worth considering **server-side filtering** for better performance and scalability
